# Part Omega

## Chapter 1

* We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause.
* (Western Science) In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods...
* (Theo says) Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died.
* It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.
* For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought.
* Research became secret, nations’ efforts a cause of fascinated, suspicious attention.
* But across continents, national and racial boundaries, we watched each other suspiciously, obsessively, feeding on rumour and speculation.
* We should have been warned in the early 1990s.
* We thought that we knew the reasons, that the fall was deliberate, a result of more liberal attitudes to birth control and abortion, the postponement of pregnancy by professional women pursuing their careers, the wish of families for a higher standard of living.
* most of us thought the fall was desirable, even necessary.
* Most of the concern was less about a falling population than about the wish of nations to maintain their own people, their own culture, their own race, to breed sufficient young to maintain their economic structures.
* ...suicides increased. Not mainly among the old, but among my generation, the middle - aged, the generation who would have to bear the brunt of an ageing and decaying society’s humiliating but insistent needs.
* We can experience nothing but the present moment, live in no other second of time, and to understand this is as close as we can get to eternal life. But our minds reach back through centuries for the reassurance of our ancestry and, without the hope of posterity, for our race if not for ourselves, without the assurance that we being dead yet live, all pleasures of the mind and senses sometimes seem to me no more than pathetic and crumbling defences shored up against our ruins.
* (Theo teaching history) “What is the point of all this?"

### Explanation
- Sudden Infertility
- Science is no longer our god
- History lost its meaning as a subject

## Chapter 2

### ① Theodore Faron and Xan Lyppiatt talking about their schoolhood

He was silent for a moment, then said: “The thing is this, schoolmasters want to understand you, that’s what they think they’re paid for. I keep them puzzled. Hard worker, top marks, housemaster’s pet, safe for an Oxford scholarship one term; next term big, big trouble.” “What sort of trouble?” “Not enough to get kicked out, and of course next term I’m a good boy again. It confuses them, gets them worried.” I didn’t understand him either, but it didn’t worry me. I didn’t understand myself. I know now, of course, why he liked having me at Woolcombe. I think I guessed almost from the beginning. He had absolutely no commitment to me, no responsibility for me, not even the commitment of friendship or the responsibility of personal choice. He hadn’t chosen me. I was his cousin, I was wished on him, I was there. With me at Woolcombe he need never face the inevitable question: “Why don’t you invite your friends here for the holidays?” Why should he? He had his fatherless cousin to entertain. I lifted from him, an only child, the burden of excessive parental concern. I was never particularly aware of that concern but, without me, his parents might have felt constrained to show it. From boyhood he couldn’t tolerate questions, curiosity, interference in his life. I sympathized with that; I was very much the same. If there was time enough or purpose in it, it would be interesting to trace back our common ancestry to discover the roots of this obsessive self-sufficiency. I realize now that it was one of the reasons for my failed marriage. It is probably the reason why Xan has never married.

##### General topic
The passage is describing people’s desire of power and self-centered mind. It shows not only Xan’s strong desire of power but also the desire of common people including Theo; this topic is closely related to the whole novel.

##### Viewpoint of the narrator and its effect
Throughout the novel, the author uses both first and third personal view in order to illustrate the scenes effectively. However, this passage mainly uses first personal view, helping readers to focus on Theo’s thoughts.

##### How does this passage fit in with the rest of the text?
This passage describes the self-centered mind of Xan and common people including Theo. It implies the future combat between Theo and Xan which is for the power.

### ② Sympathy for Xan

We went to the bridge at sunset with a bottle of his father’s claret, the two pistols, my arms filled with flowers from the walled garden. We drank the bottle between us; then Xan balanced on the parapet, firing both pistols into the air as I shouted out the names. It is one of the moments from my boyhood which have remained with me, an evening of pure joy, unshadowed, untainted by guilt or satiety or regret, immortalized for me in that image of Xan balanced against the sunset, of his flaming hair, of the pale petals of roses floating downstream under the bridge until they were lost to sight.

##### Explanation
Xan’s human aspect is explored (emotionally heightens the paradox)

## Chapter 3

### Theo did not care about the world’s devastation
* But at heart I am touched only by the thought of Woolcombe;

## Chapter 4

### ① Theodore Faron never knew real love

My mother said little except to ask what I had spent and to reimburse me. If she suspected that some of the prints were worth more than I told her I had paid, she never questioned, but I knew that she was pleased. I didn’t love her but I did steal for her. I learned early and at that kitchen table that there are ways of avoiding, without guilt, the commitments of love.

##### Explanation
Theodore Faron did not love his wife (Helena Faron), his daughter (Natalie Faron), and his mother. He never knew true love.

### ② Theodore's father

Thinking about him now for the first time in years, there are no adjectives which I can honestly conjure up, not even that he was gentle, kind, intelligent, loving. He may have been all of these things, I just don’t know. All I know about him is that he was dying. His cancer wasn’t quick or merciful—when is it merciful?—and he took nearly three years to die. It seems that most of my childhood was subsumed in those years by the look and the sound and the smell of his death. He was his cancer. I could see nothing else then and I can see nothing else now. And for years my memory of him, less memory than reincarnation, was one of horror. A few weeks before his death he cut his left index finger opening a tin and the wound became infected. Through the bulky lint-and-gauze bandage applied by my mother seeped blood and pus. It seemed not to worry him; he would eat with his right hand, leaving his left resting on the table, gently regarding it, with an air of slight surprise, as if it were separate from his body, nothing to do with him. But I couldn’t take my eyes from it, hunger fighting with nausea. To me it was an obscene object of horror. Perhaps I projected on to his bandaged finger all my unacknowledged fear of his mortal illness.

##### General topic
The passage talks about how distant Theo’s father and his memory to Theo as he tries to recall them; Theo recognizes that his earlier years of experience with his father while he was suffering from cancer led him to be left with memories of horror when he thinks about his father.

##### Tone
The passage is narrated by Theo in first person narrative. As Theo describes his memory of his father, he emphasizes the lack of knowledge by repeating how he has no experience of human interaction with his father: he says “thinks about him now for the first time in years”, “no adjective which he can conjure up”, and “I could see nothing else then and I can see nothing else now.” Though he is talking about his father’s mortal illness – cancer – he tells his thoughts in a calm and distant voice.

##### How does this passage fit in with the rest of the text?
This passage in which Theo talks about his father’s cancer provides a broader connection to the novel itself: humankind is suffering from their own mortal illness, Omega. Like Theo, humans do not think about themselves, they don’t try to understand each other which in turn drag them to be forgotten of existence and importance.

## Chapter 5

### ① Theodore was "shameful" when he ran over his daughter.

And I remember the humiliation. I couldn’t move, couldn’t get out of the car, couldn’t even stretch out my hand to the door.

...

Horror and guilt subsumed grief. Perhaps if Helena had been able to say, “It’s worse for you, darling,” or “It’s as bad for you, darling,” we might have salvaged something from the wreckage of a marriage which from the start hadn’t been particularly seaworthy. But of course she couldn’t; that wasn’t what she believed. She thought that I cared less, and she was right. She thought that I cared less because I loved less, and she was right about that too. I was glad to be a father. When Helena told me she was pregnant I felt what I presume are the usual emotions of irrational pride, tenderness and amazement. I did feel affection for my child, although I would have felt more had she been prettier—she was a miniature caricature of Helena’s father—more affectionate, more responsive, less inclined to whine. I’m glad that no other eyes will read these words. She has been dead for almost twenty-seven years and I still think of her with complaint. But Helena was obsessed by her, totally enchanted, enslaved, and I know that what spoiled Natalie for me was jealousy. I would have got over it in time, or at least come to terms with it. But I wasn’t given time. I don’t think Helena ever believed that I’d run Natalie over on purpose, at least not when she was rational; even at her most bitter she managed to prevent herself from saying the unforgivable words, as a woman burdened with a sick and cantankerous husband, out of superstition or a remnant of kindness, will bite back the words, “I wish you were dead.” But, given the chance, she would rather have had Natalie alive than me. I’m not blaming her for that. It seemed perfectly reasonable at the time and it seems so now.

##### Explanation
Even though Theo was a dad, he was not shocked about the death of his daughter. Rather, he was ashamed. This shows Theodore did not actually love Natalie Faron.

##### What is the general topic of the passage as compared to that of the text as a whole?
The passage indicates that Theo’s feeling when he accidently killed his daughter is very different from that of the other people. Theo cannot recollect the memory of his daughter without complaints, showing the reader how ingrained his tendency toward judgment is.
As the story progresses, it becomes more clear that Theo is inexperienced with love.
##### How does the tone of the narrator affect the meaning of the passage?
The passage is narrated by Theo in first-person view, but he describes his tragic event as if it was the other’s. The tone is not so grieving but rather complaining. The readers become skeptical on his view of the world and criticizes the narrator(Theo) instead of sympathizing with.
##### How does this passage fit in with the rest of the text?
The passage provides a general idea for understanding of what characteristic Theo has. Through the rest of the text, readers can observe the transformation of Theo from who he was in the passage to emotionally more engaged person by the end of the story.


## Chapter 6

### Pram & Doll
Maternal desire, once polupar, but now out of fashion.

## Chapter 7

##### Jasper Palmer-Smith
One of Theo’s old history teachers who selected Theo as his favorite student during Theo’s time as an Oxford undergraduate.

##### Hilda Palmer-Smith
Senile. Dead by Quietus.

##### Roaring Roger & Soapy Sam
Man’s infertility is God’s punishment for his disobedience, his sinfulness.

##### Rosie McClure
God is love and everything is justified by love.

## Chapter 8

The few farmhouses to the right of the wide green were still standing but most of their windows were boarded up. In places the boarding had been smashed and through the splinters and spears of jagged glass edging the window frames he could glimpse the remnants of peeling wallpaper, flowered patterns once chosen with anxious care but now in tattered fragments, frail transitory banners of departed life. On one of the roofs slates were beginning to slide, revealing the rotting timbers, and the gardens were wildernesses of shoulder-high grass and weeds.

##### Explanation

### ① Imagery and Allusion

Phyllis Dorothy James employs **imagery** and **allusion** here. Other usage are...

-	representation of human civilization in the past: The Tempest, architecture, deserted village
-	what humankind has achieved, what will be lost and become meaningless
-	general mood of hopelessness, apathy, and despair
-	repetition to come in the future: indirect allusion to the birth and life of Jesus
-	both hope and despair as humankind will start again, but not really different from the time before

### ② Theodore gave up his Warden advisor job
I gave up any such right when I relinquished my appointment as his adviser.

##### Explanation
Theodore Faron was initially not interested in power.

### ③ People just don't care.

Theo said: I don’t think you’ll start a revolution on the issue of the Sojourners, or on the Quietus for that matter. People don’t care enough.”

Julian said: “We want to help them to care.”

“Why should they? They live without hope on a dying planet. What they want is security, comfort, pleasure. The Warden of England can promise the first two, which is more than most foreign governments are managing to do.”

##### Explanation
People are apathetic about the world and only interested in their benefits. And after all, people are already dying and they just don't care anymore.

### ④ Isle of Penal Colony
“The island is a living hell. Those who went there human are nearly all dead and the rest are devils.

## Chapter 9

Hilda Palmer-Smith is killed at Quietus (Barges). Theo acknowledges that some Quietus is forced, and decides to talk to Xan just as group later known as "Five Fishes" asked for.

* Quietus
* Compulsory semen testing
* Sojourners
* Penal isle
* Election

## Chapter 10
Theo's primary motivation is not the horror of Quietus. It is his indignation about how he was treated when he tried to intervene.

*But was he motivated less by outrage at the horror of the Quietus than by the memory of his own humiliation, the carefully judged blow, his body hauled up the beach and dumped as if it were an unwanted carcase?*

## Chapter 11

The system has the merit of simplicity and gives the illusion of democracy to people who no longer have the energy to care how or by whom they are governed as long as they get what the Warden has promised: freedom from fear, freedom from want, freedom from boredom.

##### Explanation
There is no democracy; the council system just pretends to be democratic.

## Chapter 12

### ① Fatalism in the Society

“You are a historian. You know what evils have been perpetrated through the ages to ensure the survival of nations, sects, religions, even of individual families. Whatever man has done for good or ill has been done in the knowledge that he has been formed by history, that his life-span is brief, uncertain, insubstantial, but that there will be a future, for the nation, for the race, for the tribe. That hope has finally gone except in the minds of fools and fanatics.

...

We see reversions to old myths, old superstitions, even to human sacrifice, sometimes on a massive scale. That this country has been largely spared this universal catastrophe is due to the five people round this table. In particular it is due to the Warden of England. We have a system extending from this Council, down to the Local Councils, which retains a vestige of democracy for those few who still care. We have a humane direction of labour which pays some regard to individual wishes and talents, and which ensures that people continue to work even though they have no posterity to inherit the rewards of their labour. Despite the inevitable desire to spend, to acquire, to satisfy immediate wants, we have sound money and low inflation. We have plans that will ensure that the last generation fortunate enough to live in the multiracial boarding house we call Britain will have stored food, necessary medicines, light, water and power. Beside these achievements, does the country greatly care that some Sojourners are discontented, that some of the aged choose to die in company, that the Man Penal Colony isn’t pacified?”

##### Explanation

Carl: "Faced with the prospect of extinction, humans no longer care about minor social ills."

Within the society, people do not have hope to dream about the better life and everything is planned in many ways (“History, which interprets the past to understand and confront the future is the least rewarding discipline for a dying species.”) In this sense, the revolution of Five Fishes can be interpreted as a trial to break through the common fatalism within the society and a dream for the better future.

Suggests a Theo as a ‘History’ professor → Useless if there is no next generation → Represents uselessness of civilization. 

## Chapter 13

“At first because I thought I’d enjoy it. The power, I suppose. But it wasn’t only that. I could never bear to watch someone doing badly what I knew I could do well. After the first five years I found I was enjoying it less, but by then it was too late. Someone has to do it and the only people who want to are the four round that table. Would you prefer Felicia? Harriet? Martin? Carl? Carl could do it, but he’s dying. The other three couldn’t keep the Council together, let alone the country.” “So that’s why. Disinterested public duty?” “Have you ever known anyone to give up power, real power?” “Some people do.” “And have you seen them, the walking dead? But it’s not the power, not entirely. I’ll tell you the real reason. I’m not bored. Whatever else I am now, I’m never bored.”

We plan for the sake of planning, pretending that man has a future. How many people really believe that we shall find live seed now?”

I’m not a tyrant, but I can’t afford to be merciful. Whatever it is necessary to do, I shall do.”

##### Explanation
Thirst for Power is contagious. Warns possible revolt and shows off power.

## Chapter 14
Theo could hear the contempt in his voice. “Holding up the Cross of Christ before the savages, as the missionaries did in South America. Like them, get yourselves butchered on the beaches? Don’t you read any history? There are only two reasons for that kind of folly. One is that you have a yearning for martyrdom. There’s nothing new in that, if it’s the way your religion takes you. I’ve always seen it as an unhealthy mixture of masochism and sensuality but I can see its appeal to a certain cast of mind. What is new is that your martyrdom won’t even be commemorated, won’t even be noticed. In seventy-odd years it will have no possible value because there will be no one left on earth to give it value, no one even to put up a small wayside shrine to the new Oxford martyrs. The second reason is more ignoble and Xan would understand it very well. If you did succeed, what an intoxication of power! The Isle of Man pacified, the violent living in peace, crops sown and harvested, the sick cared for, Sunday services in the churches, the redeemed kissing the hands of the living saint who made it all possible. Then you’ll know what the Warden of England feels every waking moment, what he enjoys, what he can’t do without. Absolute power in your little kingdom. I can see the attraction of that; but it won’t happen.”

##### Explanation
Julian speculates that a small group of people might be able to travel to the penal colony and restore order through love. With contempt, Theo tells her that such an idiotic venture could only be motivated by a desire for martyrdom—which, given the Omega, will not even be remembered—or a desire for the power that would come from ruling the penal colony.

## Chapter 15
If there had been no Omega, these were aims which a man might be prepared to fight for, even to suffer for. But if there had been no Omega, the evils would not exist. It was reasonable to struggle, to suffer, perhaps even to die, for a more just, a more compassionate society, but not in a world with no future where, all too soon, the very words “justice,” “compassion,” “society,” “struggle,” “evil,” would be unheard echoes on an empty air.

##### Explanation
Theo recognizes that in a world without the Omega, these reforms might have been worth fighting for, whereas now everyone is just concerned with living out the remainder of their life in peace and relative comfort.

## Chapter 16
### ① Helena's background
I married her because she was the Master’s daughter and that conferred prestige; because she, too, had taken a degree in history and I thought we had intellectual interests in common; and because I found her physically attractive and was thus able to convince my frugal heart that, if this wasn’t love...

##### Explanation
No real relationship.

### ② Fragility of civilization 
One might have imagined that with the fear of pregnancy permanently removed, and the unerotic paraphernalia of pills, rubber and ovulation arithmetic no longer necessary, sex would be freed for new and imaginative delights. The opposite has happened. Even those men and women who would normally have no wish to breed apparently need the assurance that they could have a child if they wished.

## Chapter 17

George Rawlings → Chief Inspector of SSP

SSP (Social Security Police) comes to Theo's house. SSP talks about recent explosions in Quietus ceremonies and problems in Sojourners repatriation. SSP shows Theo the phamplet of Five Fishes. Theo admits he has seen it, but he denies his relation to the five fishes. However, this implies that Theo did not convince Xan successfully that he was acting by his own.

## Chapter 18

He had begun the diary less as a record of his life (for whom and why? What life?) than as a regular and a self-indulgent exploration, a means of making sense of the past years, part catharsis, part comforting affirmation. The diary, which had become a routine part of his life, was pointless if he had to censor, to leave out, if he had to deceive not illumine.

##### Explanation
Theo takes care to lock his diary in a desk drawer but realizes that such a defense would be futile if the State Security Police were truly determined to look for it. He is frustrated by the thought that he might have to censor himself in the diary. Though Theo did not feel frightened when the SSP visited, the process of writing about it leaves him fearful that he did not handle the encounter as well as he thought.

## Chapter 19
### ① Theo ♡ Julian
I saw her today for the first time since our meeting in the Pitt Rivers Museum. I was buying cheese in the covered market and had turned from the counter with my small, carefully wrapped packets of Roquefort, Danish blue, Camembert, when I saw her only a few yards from me. She was choosing fruit, not shopping as I was for the increasingly finicky taste of one, but pointing out her choice without hesitation, holding out an open canvas bag with liberality to receive fragile brown bags almost bursting with the golden, pitted globes of oranges, the gleaming curves of bananas, the russet of Cox’s Orange Pippins. I saw her in a glow of effulgent colour, skin and hair seeming to absorb radiance from the fruit, as if she were lit not by the hard glaring lights of the store, but by a warm southern sun. I watched while she handed over a note, then counted out coins to give the storekeeper the exact money, smiling as she handed it over, watched still as she hoisted the wide strap of the canvas bag over her shoulder, sagging a little with the weight. Shoppers shuffled between us but I stood rooted, unwilling, perhaps unable to move, my mind a tumult of extraordinary and unwelcome sensations. I was seized with a ludicrous urge to dash to the flower-stall, press notes into the florist’s hands, seize from their tubs the bundles of daffodils, tulips, hot-house roses and lilies, pile them into her arms and take the bag from her encumbered shoulder. It was a romantic impulse, childish and ridiculous, which I hadn’t felt since I was a boy. I had distrusted and resented it then. Now it appalled me by its strength, its irrationality, its destructive potential.

...

I am fifty years old and I have never known what it is to love. I can write those words, know them to be true, but feel only the regret that a tone-deaf man must feel because he can’t appreciate music, a regret less keen because it is for something never known, not for something lost.

##### What is the general topic of the passage as compared to that of the text as a whole?
The passage takes readers to the moment Theo realizes that he is love with Julian. We can see some “logos” when he uses the words like ‘distrusted,’ or ‘resented.’ it is said that the opposite of love is not an anger or resentment but an indifference. So here, Theo’s emotional disturbance is the proof of him being in love. Furthermore, he begins to care more about others.

##### How does the tone of the narrator affect the meaning of the passage?
The passage is narrated by Theo in the 1st person point of view when Theo himself explains how he is in love. We can see his tone conveying excitement, nervousness and more. The “pathos” is made visible in this section.

##### How does this passage fit in with the rest of the text?
This passage, which is the last chapter of part Omega, is a turning point for Theo’s personal transformation from egocentric and self-centered man to be a caring and an affectionate one.

# Part Alpha

## Chapter 20
Theo felt weird after his trip. Theo calls Helena and asks if something happened. Helena talks about recent dissidents interrupting Quietus. He also has dreams about Five Fishes berating him. Theo finds Binsey, where him and Five Fishes have first met, abandoned.

## Chapter 21

### ① Mirium's background

[Mirium]: I must have been one of the first to know. I was there at the end. Now I shall be there at the beginning.”

##### Explanation
Mirium talks that she worked at maternity department of the John Radcliffe.

### ② Julian talks her pregnancy to Theo

The chapel was dark but the group had lit eight night lights and had set them in a line in front of the altar. He wondered whether Rolf had secreted them here in advance of need or whether they had been left by other, less transient visitors. The wicks flickered briefly in the breeze from the open door, throwing shadows on the stone floor and on the pale, unpolished wood before settling into a gentle milky glow. At first he thought that the chapel was empty, and then he saw their three dark heads rising from one of the box pews. They moved out into the narrow aisle and stood regarding him. They were dressed as for a journey, Rolf in a Breton cap and large, grubby sheepskin jacket, Luke in a shabby black coat and muffler, Julian in a long cloak almost to the ground. In the dim light of the candles their faces were soft blurs. No one spoke. Then Luke turned, picked up one of the candles and held it high. Julian moved towards Theo and looked up into his face, smiling.

She said: “It’s true, Theo, feel.”

Under the cloak she was wearing a smock over baggy trousers. She took his right hand and guided it under the cotton of the smock, pulling the elastic of the trousers taut. The swollen belly felt tight and his first thought was of wonder that this huge convexity was so little visible beneath her clothes. At first her skin, stretched but silken smooth, felt cool under his resting hand, but imperceptibly the warmth passed from his skin to hers so that he could no longer feel any difference and it seemed to him that their flesh had become one. And then, with a sudden convulsive spasm, his hand was almost kicked away. She laughed, and the joyous peal rang out and filled the chapel.

“Listen,” she said, “listen to her heartbeat.”

It was easier for him to kneel, so he knelt, unselfconsciously, not thinking of it as a gesture of homage but knowing that it was right that he should be on his knees. He placed his right arm round her waist and pressed his ear against her stomach. He couldn’t hear the beating heart, but he could hear and feel the movements of the child, feel its life. He was swept by a tide of emotion which rose, buffeted and engulfed him in a turbulent surge of awe, excitement and terror, then receded, leaving him spent and weak. For a moment he knelt there, unable to move, half-supported by Julian’s body, letting the smell of her, the warmth of her, the very essence of her seep into him.

##### What is the general topic of the passage as compared to that of the text as a whole?
The birth of new life and sanctity of human are general themes in the book. The passage indicates the presence of baby is a huge hope for humanity, showing readers the how precious human lives are.
##### Consider any details of setting or context (time period, location) 
The location is a dark, quiet chapel which creates sacred atmosphere. When Theo touches Julian’s belly, the baby made responses and Julian’s laugh filled the dark, quiet chapel. This alludes that the sacred birth of a baby would be the hope for the dark, depressed society

##### How does this passage fit in with the rest of the text?
The passage is in chapter 21, Alpha part. In Alpha part, the ‘Five Fishes’ begins to flee away from Warden to protect the baby and Theo, who was apathetic to issues, turns to be active. Desperate struggle and sacrifice of the ‘Five Fishes’ come after this passage, and suggests the restoration of human dignity. 

## Chapter 22
Since SSP knows Theo's car number, Theo goes to Jasper Palmer-Smith to borrow his car. Theo finds Jasper shot himself in the head. The house is extremely organized, suggesting Jasper made it easier for cleaing up his remainders. Miriam searches for things needed for the delivery, and Theo takes Jasper's gun in his house, with only one bullet loaded. Miriam warns Theo to tell no one about the gun, including Rolf and Julian.

## Chapter 23

### ① Rolf wants to be a leader

[Rolf]: “We can’t have two leaders of this expedition.”

##### Explanation
Rolf talks to Theo that this group cannot have two leaders, suggesting he wants to be the leader. Theo does not admit that this group needs a leader, since there is only five (Mirium, Theo, Julian, Rolf, Luke) and they even don't have a solid plan. Theo then talks that Rolf can take the leader if  he does not require absolute obedience and if that would make Rolf feel better.

### ② Rolf wants to be the next warden, using the baby

“Not his power, mine. I’m not worried about her safety. The Council won’t harm her, or the baby. But it will be me, not Xan Lyppiatt, who presents my child to the world, and then we’ll see who’s Warden of England.”

“So what are your plans?”

“How do you mean?” Rolf’s voice was suspicious.

“Well, you must have some idea what you plan to do if you manage to wrest power away from the Warden.”

“It won’t be a question of wresting it away. The people will give it to me. They’ll have to if they want Britain repopulated.”

“Oh, I see. The people will give it to you. Well, you’re probably right. What then?”

“I shall appoint my own Council but without Xan Lyppiatt as a member. Lyppiatt’s had his share of power.”

...

“I don’t have to please Miriam.

...

“What I can do and he can’t is to father the new race.

...

“Why should he be a monster? Why shouldn’t he be normal, my child and hers?”

##### Explanation
Rolf plans himself to be the next Warden of England, and talks that he will not change the policies since they are all necessary. 

## Chapter 24

Rolf drives so fast, and even though Mirium asks to slow down for the baby getting shocked, the tire gets flat. They try to fix the car but fail, and decides to camp out until daylight.

## Chapter 25
Rolf and Theo talks about their religion while camping out. 

## Chapter 26
Theo's last diary. Theo admits that Rolf has some natural leadership ability.

## Chapter 27
But He’s supposed to be just. If He wants belief He’d better provide some evidence.”

It was, he saw, a serious question, not a retaliation, and he gave it a serious and truthful answer. “I convinced myself I did when I married. I willed myself into the appropriate feelings without knowing what the appropriate feelings were. I endowed her with qualities she didn’t have and then despised her for not having them. Afterwards I might have learned to love her if I had thought more of her needs and less of my own.”

Can you understand that, the need to hurt someone because you can no longer love?”

##### Explanation
Five Fishes and Theo gets attacked by group of Omegas, and Luke dies. Julian overreacts, and Rolf questions about the real father of the baby to Mirium. Mirium tells that Luke is the actual father. Being shocked, Rolf leaves the group.

## Chapter 28

At first his voice sounded strange to his own ears, but by the time he got to the psalm the words had taken over and he spoke quietly, with confidence, seeming to know them by heart. “ ‘Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end. Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of men. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a watch in the night.’”

##### Explanation
Burial of Luke. Theo is not religious but feels that religion is hope itself, and something right.

## Chapter 29
We need transport, water and food. As soon as it’s dark I’ll walk into the nearest village and steal a car. We’re only a few miles from one. I saw its lights in the distance just before the Omegas got us.”

He almost expected Miriam to ask how. Instead she said: “It’s worth a try. Don’t take more risks than you need.”

Julian said: “Please, Theo, don’t take the gun.” He turned on her, biting back anger. “I shall take what I need to take and do what I have to do. How much longer can you go on without water? We can’t live on blackberries. We need food, drink, blankets, things for the birth. We need a car. If we can get into hiding before Rolf gets to the Council there’s still a hope. Or perhaps you’ve changed your mind. Perhaps you want to follow his example and give yourself up.”

She shook her head but didn’t speak. He saw that there were tears in her eyes. He wanted to take her in his arms. Instead he stood distanced, and, putting his hand in his inner pocket, felt for the cold weight of the gun.

##### Explanation
Predicting that Rolf will deliver the news of pregnancy to the Warden, remaining people try to run away. Since they are near a village, Theo resolves to go steal a car once night falls. Julian begs him not to take the gun, but he angrily refuses her request. He sees that he has hurt her feelings but resists the urge to comfort her, choosing instead to stay at a distance with his gun.

## Chapter 30
Theo breaks into a house of old couple. They are watching *Neighbors*, soap opera from the 90s. Theo says he is sorry, and tie them up on their bed. Theo takes the car (MOA 694).

## Chapter 31

### ① Theo feels guilt about the old lady

Miriam’s voice was firm, unnaturally loud, almost shouting in his ear. “You didn’t kill her! If she was going to die of shock it would have happened when you first showed her the gun. You don’t know why she died. It was natural causes, it must have been. It could have happened anyway. She was old and she had a weak heart. You told us. It wasn’t your fault, Theo, you didn’t mean it.”

...

He said: “The worst is that I enjoyed it. I actually enjoyed it!”

Miriam was unloading the car, shouldering the blankets. “Enjoyed tying up that old man and his wife? Of course you didn’t enjoy it. You did what you had to do.”

“Not the tying up. I didn’t mean that. But I enjoyed the excitement, the power, the knowledge that I could do it. It wasn’t all horrible. It was for them, but not for me.”

...

Theo, I can’t wish that she had never been conceived. I can’t think of her without joy.”

...

Get used to it. Why the hell should you escape guilt? It’s part of being human.

##### Explanation
Miriam tries to convince Theo that the old woman’s death is not his fault, but Theo, disgusted by himself, admits that he enjoyed the thrill of power he felt when he realized he was capable of overpowering the old couple.

### ② Theo prays

Oh God, he prayed, please let it still be there, let it still be there. It was the first time he had prayed in forty years, but the words were less a petition than a half-superstitious hope that somehow, by the strength of his need, he could will the shed into existence.

##### Explanation
Religion no more a serious belief in salvation, but rather an expression of hope and love.

## Chapter 32

### ① Irrational love

The emotion he felt towards her was as mysterious as it was irrational. He needed to understand it, to define its nature, to analyse what he knew was beyond analysis. But some things now he did know, and perhaps they were all he needed to know. He wished only her good. He would put her good before his own. He could no longer separate himself from her. He would die for her life.

##### Explanation
Theo feels irrational love to Julian. Theo has changed.

### ② Mirium and Theo willing to sacrifice themselves

“But you’ll have to cross an open field. They’ll see you.” She said: “I have to go, Theo. There are things we need. I have to take that risk.” But she was being kind. It was water they needed most and their need was his fault. He said: “Let me go. You stay with her.” Miriam said: “She wants you with her. Now that the baby’s born, she needs you more than she needs me. I have to make sure the fundus is well contracted and check that the afterbirth is complete. When that’s done it will be safe to leave her. Try to get the baby to the breast. The sooner he begins sucking the better.”

##### What is the general topic of the passage as compared to that of the text as a whole?
This shows the Hope and Action caused by human relationships in general. In the book, this paragraph shows mainly about how Theo and others are changed after having true relationship with others (Theo is needed by somebody.), and the baby is depicted as a hope itself which is protected, and being protected by these human relationships. 
##### Consider any details of setting or context
This passage depicts the conversation between Miriam and Theo, willing to help each other and to sacrifice themselves. As the passage used a 3rd person view, in this way, it better shows the relationships and interactions between characters and inner thinking which better depicts how Theo is changed and how the hope is created.
##### How does this passage fit in with the rest of the text?
As the passage is in Chapter 32, these are the parts when Theo encounters new birth of a baby and his struggle to protect ‘the hope’ (= baby). During these dynamic changes, Theo got to know about being engaged in the relationship and show how it’s important and significant. And not only Theo, but also other characters get to know the value of true human relationship.

## Chapter 33

### ① Theo's love

“Nothing and no one will separate us, not life nor death, nor principalities, nor powers, nor anything that is of the heavens nor anything that is of the earth.”

##### Explanation
Although Theo did not give up his reluctant behavior towards the world, he became more serious about relationships by loving Julian.

### ② Theo finally takes the power

Theo thought: It begins again, with jealousy, with treachery, with violence, with murder, with this ring on my finger. He looked down at the great sapphire in its glitter of diamonds, at the ruby cross, twisting the ring, aware of its weight. Placing it on his hand had been instinctive and yet deliberate, a gesture to assert authority and ensure protection. He had known that the Grenadiers would come armed. The sight of that shining symbol on his finger would at least make them pause, give him time to speak. Did he need to wear it now? He had all Xan’s power within his grasp, that and more. With Carl dying, the Council was leaderless. For a time at least he must take Xan’s place. There were evils to be remedied; but they must take their turn. He couldn’t do everything at once, there had to be priorities. Was that what Xan had found? And was this sudden intoxication of power what Xan had known every day of his life? The sense that everything was possible to him, that what he wanted would be done, that what he hated would be abolished, that the world could be fashioned according to his will. He drew the ring from his finger, then paused and pushed it back. There would be time later to decide whether, and for how long, he needed it.

##### Explanation
The desire of power and self-centered mind plays a key role throughout the book. Not only the dictator Xan but also other characters including Rolf and Theo want power. Xan restricts the whole society to reserve his power (Quietus, Compulsory sperm testing, no election, penal isle, Sojourners...), Rolf betrays the group for his success, and Theo finally takes the power of the society.
